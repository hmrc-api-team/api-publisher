    # Overview
    This is an example API that allows software developers to test that their applications can connect with the HMRC API Platform. It also acts as a hands-on tutorial for developers to get started with HMRC APIs.

    It includes resources for testing access to the three different access levels:

    - Say hello world is an example of an unrestricted endpoint
    - Say hello user is an example of a user-restricted endpoint
    - Say hello application is an example of an application-restricted endpoint
    
    Further details of the different access levels are given on 
    the [Authorisation](/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.

    For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients
    for this API, see [Tutorials](/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).

    # Versioning
    When an API changes in a way that is backwards-incompatible, we increase the version number of the API. 
    See our [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#versioning) for more on versioning.

    # Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
    
    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our 
    [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors) for more on errors.

        Bad or expired token.
        This can happen if the user or HMRC revoked or expired an access token.
        To fix, you should re-authenticate the user.

        Bad OAuth request (wrong consumer key, bad nonce, expired
        timestamp...). Unfortunately, re-authenticating the user won't help here.

        Any request to this endpoint initiates a 'Hello World' response.
